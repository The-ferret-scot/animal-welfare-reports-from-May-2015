Well run business and at good standards applied. Business is focused mainly on breeding and providing gilts to different farms. a small proportion goes for growing and finishing on farm (~300 finishing pigs from a total of over ~2600).The in question batch has been indeed one with issues including signs of tail bite vice. [Name] is aware of the existing problems and the management appied includes isolation of individuals which show signs of this behaviour, treat infections if applicable and local antiseptic (all medicine records reflected this). If in a week time pigs don.t show signs of improvement they are killed on farm. Regarding the pig which presented a laceration on the back - pig has been treated for that but the tail (due to it's length) mantained the wound open due to constant irritation. [Name] never faced before issues with tail biting and he's now considering tail docking as a measure to stop recurrence. At time of visit I found 3 pens with a total number of
~30 pigs which were under treatment/supervision due to the same vice. As mentioned before - this specific batch has raised problems. All pens havily straw bedded - enviromental enrichment is compliant, medical attention and good practices as well comlpiant reason why at this moment no further action taken by APHA.SVI inspected all livestock on 25/08/2015.

I have phoned the farmer [Name] and reminded him it was an offence to present for transport and/or transport a pregnant female for whom 90% or more of the expected gestation has already passed.
Farmer informed me when he picked the cow for slaughter and transported her to Dingwall he did not see any signs on the cow which would lead him to believe she was pregnant. Farmer has informed me he has kept back other cows he thought may be pregnant. Last week farmer called his vet out to a heifer which he kept back from slaughter. Cow had a seizure.
Farmer currently gets his vet to pregnancy diagnose around 90 to 95% of all home bred heifers. Farmer also injects heifers and cows with an oestrogen injection to abort any possible pregnancies in female cattle intended for slaughter.
Farmer runs young bulls on the farm and has told me he would take steps to ensure in the future they do not escape and catch the heifers.
If you require any further information or assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.""",TS-Trading Standards informed

[Name] completed an Additional Food Chain Information stating that ""this cow had a cubicle injury to her right shoulder just above her right foreleg no treatment given.
However later in the afternoon the animal was reported as looking unwell and in sternal recumbancy. At 06:30 when I was completing my early morning ante-mortem checks the animal was in lateral recumbancy and in obvious distress. The Animal Welfare Officer was informed and the animal was humanely slaughtered in the lairage and transferred to the cattle slaughter line. Photographs and videos of the animal were taken before slaughter.
At post-mortem examination there was a soft tissue injury of the right foreleg as [Name] had described. However the animal had a long standing kidney infection and evidence of a recent bowel lesion resulting in a peritonitis which would be the likely cause of the animal becomming unwell in the lairage.

[Plant Name & Number],17/08/2016,On farm welfare,Red Meat: Pigs,Welfare on farm,4,Other,"Today at 09:10 while carrying out ante mortem inspection for the pigs belonging to the above mentioned farm my colleague [Name] identified 19 pigs with different degrees of tail biting, some of them showing open wounds and swollen tails, no additional FCI was presented stating these conditions. At post mortem inspection the referred carcases were identified with severe tail bites in some cases and enlarged lynph nodes. One carcass was totally condemned due to presence of abscess near the spinal cord and troughout the lungs. As no further abscessation was found in other cases the affected areas were rejected. In my professional opinion pigs with evidence of swelling/abscesation in the base of the tail should not be presented for slaughter and only when a previously bitten tail has healed leaving no open wound or swelling it can be sent for slaughter once the withdrawal periods have been observed and accompanied by the relevant food chain information.
Pictures were taken as evidence and some tails are kept secured in the freezer in case required.",APHA-Animal Health Office informed
[Plant Name & Number],18/08/2016,Welfare on transport,Red Meat: Cattle,Condition of the animals at unloading,4,Injured animals,"During AMI it was identified an animal at unloading with extensive lumps through both flanks likely due to haematoma so FBO was instructed
to kill him as soon as possible. At PMI the haematoma was confirmed with extensive
bruising in both sides of the carcass, a final total trimming of 70 Kg was carried out
afterwards. The animal was transported in the lorry within a load of 21 animals and
another load of 8 cattle. There was a note from the farmer on the FCI pointing the
haematoma along with another condition from another beast from the same batch. In
this case and taking into account the severity of the injury in my opinion this animal
should only have been transported under a vet supervision and declaration asessing
its fitness and in any case should have been sent straight to slaughter in a single
compartment with comfortable bedding as the farm is within a short distance from
the abattoir.",TS-Trading Standards informed
[Plant Name & Number],18/08/2016,On farm welfare,Red Meat: Cattle,Welfare on farm,3,Poor animals/ suspect emaciation,"A load of 8 animals arrived at [ID Number] for slaughter at around 11:40. During AMI some of them were identified in very poor condition
scoring 1/5. The majority of them showed dullness with a deep cavity with no fatty
tissue under the skin, the spine was extremely prominent and spinal processes
sharp. As a result one of the animals was ante mortem rejected as unfit for human
consumption due to suspect emaciation. Although at PMI the rest of animals were
stamped as fit for HC, it was evident the low quality of the carcases and the leanness
of its tissues. In my opinion animals should meet the minimum standards when
reared and be sent to slaughter in a suitable condition and the producers should
monitor their cattle herds adjusting their nutritional needs to meet the changing
needs throughout the year.",APHA-Animal Health Office informed
